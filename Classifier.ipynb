    "# Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "A client approaches me to solve a machine learning problem for them. They run a pathology lab that processes histological images for healthcare providers and they have created a product that measures the same features as in the *Wisconsin breast cancer data set* though using different acquisitions and processing methods. This makes their method much faster than existing ones, but it is also slightly noisier. The dataset contains measurements of several features that describe characteristics of cell nuclei present in digital images of breast tissue samples. These features include the mean, standard error, and \"worst\" (i.e., largest) values of measurements such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension. Each feature is represented by a numeric value, and each data point represents a sample from either a malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) breast tissue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client want to be able to diagnose *malignant* cancer (and distinguish them from *benign* growths) by employing machine learning techniques, and they have asked to implement this for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their requirements are:\n",
    " 1) have at least a 95% probability of detecting malignant cancer when it is present;\n",
    " 2) have no more than 1 in 10 healthy cases (those with benign tumours) labelled as positive (malignant).\n",
    " \n",
    "They have hand-labelled 300 samples, which is all they have at the moment."
